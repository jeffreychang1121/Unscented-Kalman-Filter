# Unscented-Kalman-Filter

### Kalman filters mains steps: 
### 1. Initialization 
### 2. Prediction 
### 3. Update.

- The Prediction and Update processes can be linear and non-linear. 
- A Standard Kalman Filter (KF) can be used when the process is linear
- Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters are used when the process isn't linear
- Extended Kalman Filter uses the Jacobian matrix to linearize non-linear functions
- Unscented Kalman Filter maps representative points from a Gaussian distribution
